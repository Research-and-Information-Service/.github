## The Research and Information Service

The [Research and Information Service (RaISe)](http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/research-and-information-service-raise/find-out-about-raise/) aims to meet the information needs of the Assembly Members, their staff and the secretariat in an impartial, objective, timely and non-partisan manner. It employs subject specialists and library professionals to provide research and information support across the range of Assembly business areas.

There have been rapid advances in the use of digital technology to create and disseminate information products in recent years.  Our work has increasingly involved the use of digital technology in producing and publishing information, and in seeking to understand our audience. For this reason, RaISe has developed a [Digital Strategy](http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/raise-digital-strategy-2023_final.pdf).

The purpose of this strategy is to set out a plan to direct the work of RaISe over a medium-term period in its use of digital technology, to help us focus our use of digital, to develop new capabilities appropriately, and to help others in the Assembly to understand our approach. It will enable us to monitor progress and to balance resources appropriately.

The Digital Strategy includes a vision defined by embracing digital activity to and technology to enhance our outputs and provide rich, accessible content to our customer base and beyond. In order to achieve this vision we outlined a range of objectives including exploring new methods of presenting and communicating our work, nurturing new digital skills, developing our outward face so that our resources can be accessed and used more easily and enhancing our research.

Our research staff use a range of tools and digital technologies to meet these objectives and fulfil the vision set forth in the Digital Strategy. These include analysis software such as SPSS, business intelligence software such as Microsoft Power BI and programming languages such as Python, R and Javascript. 

This GitHub is intended to enhance our researchers' ability to deliver high quality research products for our customers, to enhance how we collaborate and to provide transparency with respect to the scripts we use and how we use them to process and analyse public sector data.
